# Maze 42
Maze 42 is a 3 dimensional maze generator.
It was build to be able to generate "blueprints" for building a maze in Valheim.

For now it is a linqpad script. If i get around to it, I might convert it into a proper tool.
Will generate images like these:

Disclaimer: Code is written to work, not to be pretty. A lot of stuff I am not happy with, and moved through different attemps that has not been fully cleaned up.
